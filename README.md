# Parking App
This is an Android App developed in Android studio that utelizes a database of parking lot spots.  It simulates the available parking spots in the three main parking lots on Quinnipiac
University's Mt. Carmel Campus (North, Hilltop, and Hogan).

## How To Use
Upon opening the app, a student can enter their ID to log in.  They then have the choice of the three lots.  The lot will show green squares for available spots, and red squares for taken ones.
The student can then park in an available spot, select it on the app, and their ID will be recorded into the database.  The app will remember which spot they are parked in for easy relocation.
Once the student leaves, they can tell the app that they have moved and log out.
